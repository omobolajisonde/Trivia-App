# TRIVIA APP ðŸŽ¯

## Description

Trivia app is a web-based trivia gaming application, where users can not only play trivia games but also expand their general knowledge in various fields like `history`, `geography`, `science` etc.

Built as a project in the [Udacity's Full Stack web developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044)

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Tech Stack
### 1. Backend Dependencies
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** as an ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-CORS** to handle cross origin request from our frontend server

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
* The frontend of this project is built with **React js** and some third party packages like **react router**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites & Installation
To be able to get this application up and running, ensure to have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your device.

### Development Setup (Backend)
1. **Download the project locally by forking this repo and then clone or just clone directly via:**
```
git clone https://github.com/omobolajisonde/Trivia-App.git 
```
2. **Set up the Database**
   with Postgres running, create a trivia database
``` bash
createdb trivia
```
3. **Populate the database using the `trivia.psql` file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:**
``` bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

4. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**
```
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
>**Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

5. **Install the backend dependencies** from the backend folder in terminal run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_DEBUG=true # enables debug mode
python flaskr
```
7. **At this point, your server should be up and running** at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Development Setup (frontend)
1. **This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:**
``` bash
npm install
```
2. **Starting the frontend in devlopment mode** from the frontend folder run:
``` bash
npm start
```
3. **At this point, the frontend should be up and running** at [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Testing
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:
``` bash
dropdb bookshelf_test
createdb bookshelf_test
psql bookshelf_test < books.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
>**Note** - All tests are in the `test_flaskr.py` file.
